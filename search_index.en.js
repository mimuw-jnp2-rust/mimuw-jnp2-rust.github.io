that complement this site,\nexplanations/deeper insight during class and many examples of Rust code.\n\nGrading\n\n1/2 of the grade is based on small tasks.\n\nThere will be 8 or 9 tasks.\nEach task will be graded on a scale of 0 to 3.\nYou can get up to 21 points from the small tasks. It means that it is enough to do 7 tasks with a score of 3 points.\nYou can solve the task between the end of the lesson and strictly before the start of the next lesson.

Indeed, Rust's ownership model lies at the very core of its uniqueness. But to fully understand it and appreciate it, let's first take a look at how memory management is handled in most popular languages.\n\n\nGarbage Collection - in many high-level programming languages, like Java, Haskell or Python, memory management is done fully by the language, relieving the programmer from this burden. This prevents memory leaks and memory related errors (like use after free), but does come at a cost - there is a runtime overhead, both memory and performance wise, caused by the constantly running garbage collection algorithms and the programmer usually has very little control over when the garbage collection takes place. Also, garbage collection does not prevent concurrency-related errors, such as data races, in any way.\nThere's one language that has a lot of common parts with Rust, but it differs by having a garbage collector: OCaml. In Jane Street, programmers heavily use OCaml as their primary language, and the drawbacks brought by garbage collectors are visible. Their programmers decided to extend the OCaml compiler to be able to write code without any allocations (this approach is quite restrictive) to avoid calling the garbage collector, just so their code runs faster. That's quite a roundabout way!\n\n\nMind your own memory - in low-level languages and specific ones like C++, performance comes first so we cannot really afford to run expansive bookkeeping and cleaning algorithms. Most of these languages compile directly to machine code and have no language-specific runtime environment. That means that the only place where memory management can happen is in the produced code. While compilers insert these construction and destruction calls for stack allocated memory, it generally requires a lot of discipline from the programmer to adhere to good practices and patterns to avoid as many memory related issues as possible and one such bug can be quite deadly to the program and a nightmare to find and fix. These languages basically live by the \"your memory, your problem\" mantra.\nFor example, in C++ we get some help through variable scopes, but whenever we write a function, we have to decide ourselves how to pass the values. It's easy by mistake to copy a value, pass an invalid pointer or use some dangling reference (i.e., one pointing to an already-freed data).\n\n\nTo discuss during class\n\nWhy languages with garbage collectors are often considered slower? What different garbage collector mechanisms are there?\nWhy coding without allocations can avoid using a garbage collector?\nBesides variable scope, does C++ help in any other way with memory management?\n\nSlides\nDon't panic\n\n\nOpen the slides in a new tab (HTML)\nDownload the slides as PDF\n\nString formatting\n\n\nOpen the slides in a new tab (HTML)\nDownload the slides as PDF\n\nStart with the basics - ownership\nAnd then we have Rust. Rust is a systems programming language and in many ways it's akin to C++ - it's basically low-level with many high-level additions. But unlike C++, it doesn't exactly fall into either of the categories described above, though it's way closer to the second one. It performs no additional management at runtime, but instead imposes a set of rules on the code, making it easier to reason about and thus check for its safety and correctness at compile time - these rules make up Rust's ownership model.\nIn a way, programming in Rust is like pair-programming with a patient and very experienced partner. Rust's compiler will make sure you follow all the good patterns and practices (by having them ingrained in the language itself) and very often even tell you how to fix the issues it finds.\nDisclaimer: when delving deeper into Rust below we will make heavy use of concepts like scopes, moving data, stack and heap, which should have been introduced as part of the C++ course. If you need a refresher of any of these, it's best to do so now, before reading further.\nIn the paragraph above we mentioned a set of rules that comprise Rust's ownership model. The book starts off with the following three as its very foundation:\n\n\nEach value in Rust is tied to a specific variable - we call that variable its owner.\n\n\nThere can only be one owner at a time.\n\n\nWhen the owner goes out of scope, the value will be destroyed (or in Rust terms - dropped).\n\n\nThe third point might make you think about C++ and its automatic storage duration. We will later see that, while very similar at first, Rust expands on these mechanics quite a bit. The following code illustrates the basic version of this:\n\nSo far, so good. Variables are pushed onto the stack when they enter the scope and destroyed during stack unwinding that happens upon leaving their scope. However, allocating and deallocating simple integers doesn't impress anybody. Let's try something more complex:\n\nIf you recall the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) pattern from C++, the above is basically the same thing. We go two for two now in the similarity department, so... is Rust really any different then? There is a part of these examples that we skipped over - actually doing something with the values.\nMoving around is fun\nLet's expand on the last example. The scoping is not really important for that one, so we don't include it here.\n\nAt first glance everything looks great. If we write this code (well, an equivalent of it) in basically any other popular language, it will compile without issues - but it does not compile here and there's a good reason why.\nTo understand what's happening, we have to consult the rules again, rule 2 in particular. It says that there can only be one owner of any value at a given time. So, s and s2 cannot own the same object. Okay, makes sense, but what is happening in this line then - let s2 = s;? Experience probably tells you that s just gets copied into s2, creating a new String object. That would result in each variable owning its very own instance of the string and each instance having exactly one owner. Sounds like everyone should be happy now, but wait - in that case the last line should work no issue, right? But it doesn't, so can't be a copy. Let's see now what the compiler actually has to say:\n\n\"value moved here\" - gotcha! So s is being moved to s2, which also means that s2 now becomes the new owner of the string being moved and s cannot be used anymore. In Rust, the default method of passing values around is by move, not by copy. While it may sound a bit odd at first, it actually has some very interesting implications. But before we get to them, let's fix our code, so it compiles now. To do so, we have to explicitly tell Rust to make a copy by invoking the clone method:\n\nThe compiler is happy now and so are we. The implicit move takes some getting used to, but the compiler is here to help us. Now, let's put the good, old C++ on the table again and compare the two lines:\n\nlet s2 = s; is equivalent to auto s2 = std::move(s);\nlet s2 = s.clone() is equivalent to auto s2 = s\n\nThere are a few important things to note here:\n\n\nMaking a copy is oftentimes not cheap. Memory needs to be allocated and copied, and a call to the system has to be made. We should prefer to move things as much as possible to avoid this cost - in C++ we have a myriad of language features like std::move and r-references to achieve this. Every programmer worth their salt needs to be well versed in all of them to write efficient C++ code and simply forgetting one move can lead to significant performance loss (and this happens to even the most senior devs ever existing, let's not pretend). On the contrary, in Rust you need to make an effort to make a copy and that makes you very aware of the cost you're paying - something that we'll see quite a lot of in the language. Also, if you forget a clone there's no harm done - it just won't compile!\n\n\nHidden in all of this is another nice thing Rust gives us. In C++, nothing prevents you from using variables after they've been moved from, leading to unexpected errors in a more complex code. In Rust, that variable (in our case s) simply becomes invalid and the compiler gives us a nice error about it.\n\n\nBut what about ints?\nA good question to ask. Copying primitives is cheap. And it's not convenient for the programmer to have to always write .clone() after every primitive. If we take a look at the error from the previous example:\n\nIt says that s was moved because the String type doesn't have the Copy trait. We will talk about traits more in depth in the future lessons, but what this basically means is that String is not specified to be copied by default. All primitive types (i32, bool, f64, char, etc.) and tuples consisting only of primitive types implement the Copy trait.\nExercise\nHow to fix that code? Don't worry about efficiency yet.\n\nTo discuss during class\n\nHow does std::move work in C++? When can l-value references (&amp;) be used, and when r-value references (&amp;&amp;)?\nWhat exactly are the performance benefits in copying primitives?\n\nLet's borrow some books\nWe now know how to move things around and how to clone them if moving is not possible. But what if making a copy is unnecessary - maybe we just want to let someone look at our resource while still holding that value after they're finished. Kind of like references in C++ (but with some major differences). Consider the following example:\n\nCloning is pretty excessive here. Imagine recommending a book to your friend and instead of lending it to them for the weekend, you scan it and print an exact copy. Not the best way to go about it, is it? Thankfully, Rust allows us to access a resource without becoming an owner through the use of references and the &amp; operator. This is called a borrow.\nThe adjusted code should look like this:\n\nAs with everything, references are too, by default, immutable, which means that the read_book function is not able to modify that book passed into it. We can also borrow something mutably by specifying it both in the receiving function signature and the place it gets called. Maybe you want to have your book signed by its author?\n\nPretty neat, but doesn't seem that safe right now. Let's try to surprise our friend:\n\nFortunately for us (and our poor friend just wanting to read), the compiler steps in and doesn't let us do that, printing the following message:\n\nThis is where the famous borrow checker comes in. To keep things super safe, Rust clearly states what can and cannot be done with references and tracks their lifetimes. Exactly one of the following is always true for references to a given resource:\n\n\nThere exists only one mutable reference and no immutable references, or\n\n\nThere is any number of immutable references and no mutable ones.\n\n\nThose rules are the core of the borrow checker. Be sure that you understand it.\nYou may notice a parallel to the readers - writers problem from concurrent programming. Because of that, the way Rust's borrow checker is designed lends itself incredibly well to preventing data race related issues.\nDangling references\nRust also checks for dangling references. If we try to compile the following code:\n\nwe will get an adequate error:\n\nThe message above suggests specifing a lifetime for the returned string. In Rust, the lifetime of each variable is also a part of its type, but we will talk more about it later.\nExercise\nOur previous solution using clone() was pretty inefficient. How should you modify this code now?\n\nEveryone gets a slice\nThe last part of working with references that we will cover in this lesson are slices. A slice in Rust is a view over continuous data. Let us start with a string slice - the &amp;str type.\nNote: for the purposes of these examples we assume we are working with ASCII strings. More comprehensive articles on handling strings are linked at the end of this lesson.\nTo create a string slice from the String object s, we can simply write:\n\nThis makes use of the &amp; operator and Rust's range notation (analogous to Python's notation) to specify the beginning and end of the slice. Thus, we can also write:\n\nYou might have noticed that we always built String values using the from() method and never actually used the string literals directly. What type is a string literal then? Turns out it's the new string slice we just learned about!\n\nIn fact, it makes a lot sense - string literals, after all, are not allocated on the heap, but rather placed in a special section of the resulting binary. It's only natural we just reference that place with a slice.\nSlices can also be taken from arrays:\n\nExercise\nCan this code be further modified utilizing references? Think about the signature of count_animals, can we make it also accept string literals?\n\nObligatory reading\n\n\nThe Book, chapter 4\n\n\nRust by Example, chapter Scoping rules\n\n\nAdditional reading\n\n\nChar documentation\n\n\nWorking with strings in Rust\n\n\nAssignment 1 (graded)\nordering in Van Binh\nDeadline: group-specific.\nGrading:\n\n2 points for passing tests, cargo fmt and cargo clippy,\n1 point for manual code inspection (\"code quality\").\n\n","id":"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/02-ownership/","title":"Ownership Model"},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/03-data-types/":{"body":"Aggregating data\nBelow is a compact overview of Rust's structs.\n\n(Download the source code for this example: data_types.rs)\nEnums\nIt is often the case that we want to define a variable that can only take\na certain set of values and the values are known up front.\nJust like the below code shows, in C you can use an enum for this.\n\n(Download the source code for this example: enums.c)\nHowever, in C enums are just integers.

They can be compared to interfaces from many other mainstream languages or to type classes from Haskell, however, Rust is not an object-oriented language and there are some notable differences between type traits and Java interfaces.\nThe way we describe behavior in Rust is through methods. Traits consist of a set of these methods which then should be implemented by a type. We've already encountered examples of these, like the Clone trait which specified that the clone() method can be called on some given type. Now, let's take a deeper look and try defining our own trait.\n\n(Download the source code for this example: basic_trait.rs)\nDefault implementations\nTrait definitions can also be provided with default implementations of behaviors.\n\n(Download the source code for this example: trait_default.rs)\nWhat about derive?\nThere is a trait-related feature we have used quite extensively but not explained yet, namely the #[derive] attribute. When placed above a struct or enum, it tells the compiler to generate an implementation of certain traits automatically. For example, #[derive(Debug)] will cause the compiler to create the necessary impl Debug for YourType { ... } code behind the scenes, so that your type can be printed with {:?} in println!.\nWe'll learn about how to make it work with our own traits in the next lessons. For now, you can think of derive as a kind of code generator built into the compiler, which is especially useful when the implementation of a trait can be generalized for any type.\nBelow you can find a list of derivable traits from the standard library.\n\n\nEquality traits: Eq, PartialEq and comparison traits: Ord and PartialOrd. The Partial- versions exist because there are types which don't fulfill the reflexivity requirement of equality (NaN != NaN) or do not form a total order ( NaN &lt; 0.0 == false and NaN &gt;= 0.0 == false).\n\n\nData duplication traits: Clone and Copy\n\n\nHash - allows using values of that type as keys in a hashmap\n\n\nDefault - provides a zero-arg constructor function\n\n\nDebug - provides a formatting of the value which can be used in debugging context. Because the derive attribute automatically implements a pretty way of formatting, it is discouraged to implement this trait manually. In general, if it's possible to derive the Debug, there are no reasons against doing it.\n\n\nWhen is it possible to derive a trait?\nWhen all fields of a struct/variants of an enum implement that trait.\nShould all traits always be derived if it is possible?\nNo. Although it may be tempting to just slap #[derive(Clone, Copy)] everywhere, it would be counter-effective. For example, at some later point you might add a non-Copy field to the struct and your (or, what's worse, someone else's!) code would break. Another example: it makes little sense to use containers as keys in hashmaps or to compare tweets.\nGenerics\nSuppose we want to find the largest element in a sequence and return it. Very much on purpose, we didn't specify what type these elements would be - ideally, we would love it to work on all types that have a defined notion of a largest element. However, to make things simpler for now, let's focus only on two primitive types: i32 and char. Let's try to write the code:\n\n(Download the source code for this example: non_generic.rs)\nPerfect, it works! Now only twenty more types to go...\nOf course, Rust gives us a way to avoid all this code duplication and generalize the types we're working on.\n\nCleaner already - we merged possibly very many implementations into one. But, when we try to compile this:\n\nSince T can be of absolutely any type now, the compiler cannot be sure that operator &gt; is defined. This aligns with what we wanted, as without comparing elements we don't have a notion of the largest one either. As always, the compiler messages come to our aid:\n\nWe call this a trait bound, a way to provide constraints on what kind of types we are talking about in a given context. This implementation almost works now. Let's look at the new error.\n\nOur function attempts to take ownership, but, again, the compiler doesn't know whether T can just be trivially copied. Rust allows us to combine multiple trait bounds together:\n\n(Download the source code for this example: generic_largest.rs)\nA powerful tool\nThere's a lot more that we can do with generics:\n\n(Download the source code for this example: generics.rs)\nAn example where we can specify which generic trait implementation we want to call:\n\n(Download the source code for this example: generics_fun.rs)\nStatic vs dynamic dispatch\n\n(Download the source code for this example: static_dynamic_dispatch.rs)\nLifetimes\nLet's go into a completely different topic now.\nGoing back to the lesson about ownership, if we try to compile the following code:\n\nwe should expect to get an error:\n\nCourtesy of the borrow checker, we didn't end up with a dangling reference. But what exactly is happening behind the scenes? Rust introduces a concept of annotated lifetimes, where the lifetime of each value is being marked and tracked by the checker. Let's look at some examples:\n\n\nAnnotations\nLet's consider the following code finding the longer out of two strings:\n\nIf we try to compile this, we will get an error:\n\nThis is because Rust doesn't know which of the two provided strings (x or y) will be returned from the function. And because they potentially have different lifetimes, the lifetime of what we are returning remains unclear to the compiler - it needs our help.\nRust provides syntax for specifying lifetimes. The lifetime parameter name from the example (a) doesn't have any concrete meaning - it's just an arbitrary name for this one lifetime.\n\nSo, knowing this, let's address the compiler's demands.\n\nWhen working with lifetimes, our work will usually revolve around specifying relationships between lifetimes of different values so that the compiler can successfully reason about the program's safety. In the context of the example above, this signature means that both of the function's arguments and its output will live at least as long as lifetime 'a. In practice, this means that the output's lifetime will be equal to the smaller of the two inputs' lifetimes.\n\n(Download the source code for this example: lifetimes_basic.rs)\nTrying to compile the second variant displeases the compiler (just like we hoped).\n\nLifetime elision\nWe now know how to explicitly write lifetime parameters, but you might recall that we don't always have to do that. Indeed, Rust will first try to figure out the lifetimes itself, applying a set of predefined rules. We call this lifetime elision.\n\n(Download the source code for this example: lifetimes_elision.rs)\nThe above works, even though we didn't specify any lifetime parameters at all. The reason lies in the rules we mentioned, which are as follows (where input lifetimes are lifetimes on parameters and output lifetimes are lifetimes on return values):\n\n\nEach parameter that is a reference gets its own lifetime parameter.\n\n\nIf there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters.\n\n\nIf there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is &amp;self or &amp;mut self, the lifetime of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters.\n\n\nLet's try to understand how the compiler inferred the lifetimes of our first_two functions. We start with the following signature:\n\nThen, we apply the first rule:\n\nNext, we check the second rule. It applies here as well.\n\nWith that, we arrive at a state where all lifetimes are specified.\nStatic lifetime\nThere exists one special lifetime called 'static, which means that a reference can live for the entire duration of the program. All string literals are annotated with this lifetime as they are stored directly in the program's binary. Full type annotation of a string literal in Rust is therefore as follows:\n\nTrait + lifetimes - a challenging tandem\nLet's go back to our basic_trait.rs example. The Summary trait was really wasteful: it always allocated the Strings on heap, even though we only needed to display the formatted string, and we could do that without allocations. How? By using Display trait, of course.\nThe simplest possible optimisation would be like this:\n\n(Download the source code for this example: basic_trait_display.rs)\nThis eliminates the heap allocations, but there's another catch. What if NewsArticle already had another (non-summarizing) Display implementation? We would end up in a double-trait-implementation conflict, which is a compile-time error.\nWe can solve the one-type-one-trait-impl problem by introducing another type just for summarizing. The first attempt could be to use generics in traits:\n\n(Download the source code for this example: trait_generic_type.rs)\nThe problem here is that nothing hinders us from implement the trait (with various type parameters) for the same type, which leads to awkward ambiguity when calling the trait's methods (see main fn).\nThe use of generic types in Summary trait makes it semantics like this:\n\nA type can be summarized with any type supporting it.\n\nWhen we want the trait to require exactly one possible generic implementation for a given type, we can leverage associated types. Example here:\n\n(Download the source code for this example: trait_associated_type.rs)\nThe use of associated types in Summary trait makes it semantics like this:\n\nA type can be summarized with at most one specific type.\n\nYet another approach (arguably, the cleanest one) would be to use the impl trait syntax in a trait (quite recently stabilized!).\nExample:\n\n(Download the source code for this example: impl_trait.rs)\nObligatory reading\n\n\nThe Book, chapter 10\n\n\nPolymorphism in Rust\n\n\nOptional reading\n\nRust Blog - Precise capturing use&lt;..&gt; syntax\n\nAssignment 3 (graded)\nPassage Pathing\nDeadline: per-group.\n","id":"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/05-types-reasoning/","title":"Reasoning About Types"},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/06-closures-iterators/":{"body":"Closures\nClosures (Polish: \"domknięcia\") are anonymous functions that can access variables from the scope in which they were defined.\nClosure syntax\n\n(Download the source code for this example: closures_syntax.rs)\nClosures' types\nClosures are unnameable types. That is, each closure gets its own unique type from the compiler,\nbut we cannot name it. Therefore, closures' types must be inferred.\nWe will often use impl keyword with closure traits (e.g., impl Fn) - those traits are described below.\nClosures capture environment\nClosures can capture variables from the environment where they are defined. They can do that in two ways:\n\nCapturing References (borrowing), or\nMoving Ownership.\n\nHOW closures capture variables is one thing.\nBut even more important is WHAT closures do with their captures.\nFunctions &amp; closures hierarchy\nBased on WHAT a closure does with its captures, it implements closure traits:\n\nFnOnce - closures that may move out of their captures environment (and thus called once).\nFnMut - closures that may mutate their captures, but don't move out of their captures environment (so can be called multiple times, but require a mutable reference);\nFn - closures that do not mutate their captures (so can be called multiple times through an immutable reference).\n\nFor completeness, there is a (concrete) type of function pointers:\n\nfn - functions, closures with no captures.\n\nThose traits and the fn type form a hierarchy: fn ⊆ Fn ⊆ FnMut ⊆ FnOnce\n $$ fn \\subseteq Fn \\subseteq FnMut \\subseteq FnOnce $$ --&gt;\nThe following code sample demonstrates various ways to capture environment (borrowing or moving) and various kinds of closures, based on what they do with their captures:\n\n(Download the source code for this example: closures_capturing.rs)\nClosures as trait objects (in dynamic dispatch)\nThe following code sample shows how one can use closures as dyn Trait objects, bypassing the problem of them having anonymous types:\n\n(Download the source code for this example: closures_fun.rs)\nExamples\nWe'll go through the examples from Rust by Example.\nMore examples will be seen when working with iterators.\nIterators\nIn Rust, there is no hierarchy of types for collections (because there is no inheritance in general).\nInstead, what makes a collection is that it can be iterated over.\nA usual way in Rust to perform an iteration over something, be it a range of values or items in a collection, is creating a (lazy) iterator over it and transforming it using iterator adaptors. For example, if T: Iterator, then T::map() creates a Map&lt;T&gt; adaptor. Once a final iterator is created, it has to be actually activated (iterated over), which is most commonly done by:\n\nexhausting it with the for loop,\nmanually iterating over it using next() calls,\ncollecting its contents into inferred collection (collect()),\nconsuming it with a consuming adaptor (e.g., sum(), count),\n\n\n(Download the source code for this example: iterator_exhaustion.rs)\nIterators are highly optimised, so they are high-level code that compiles down to simple and optimised machine code (intended as zero-cost abstractions).\nWe'll go through the official docs.\n\nMost methods are defined in the Iterator trait.\nIntoIterator is also worth noting, because it makes types work with the for loop.\nFor completeness, there is FromIterator, which is required for collect() to work.\n\nReading\n\nThe Book, chapter 12 (that's a project!)\nThe Book, chapter 13\nThe Book, chapter 14\nThe Book, Advanced Functions and Closures\nThe Book, Advanced Traits\n\nAssignment 4 (graded)\nLazy\nDeadline: 06.11.2024 23:59\n","id":"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/06-closures-iterators/","title":"Closures and Iterators"},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/07-smart-pointers/":{"body":"Working with the heap\nSo far we've only used heap allocated memory indirectly by working with containers such as vectors, maps or the String type, otherwise allocating our variables on the stack. We didn't really have to be aware of the fact that these collections used the heap, as all that memory management details were hidden away from us. In this lesson we'll take a closer look at what is really happening there and how we can do that ourselves.\nTo work with heap-allocated memory, Rust features smart pointers. You should have already heard this term as it is a very important feature in C++ and the concept is virtually the same here - they are wrappers around raw allocated memory that provide additional, safety-ensuring mechanism. What defines a smart pointer in Rust is generally the implementation of two traits: Drop and Deref.\nThe Drop trait is pretty straightforward as it consists of one method - fn drop(&amp;mut self) - that is, basically, the destructor, invoked during stack unwinding.\nThe Deref trait allows us to overload the dereference (*) operator.\nDeref coercion\nApart from enabling access to the underlying value, implementing the Deref trait enables Rust to perform deref coercion on the pointer - trying to remove as many levels of indirection as it can. What it means in practice is that we will be able to use it with any code working on plain references.\n\n(Download the source code for this example: deref_coercion.rs)\nIn general, there are three possible coercions that Rust can perform:\n\n\nFrom &amp;T to &amp;U when T: Deref&lt;Target=U&gt;\n\n\nFrom &amp;mut T to &amp;mut U when T: DerefMut&lt;Target=U&gt;\n\n\nFrom &amp;mut T to &amp;U when T: Deref&lt;Target=U&gt;\n\n\nWhile the first two coercions are straightforward, the third one is possible because treating a mutable reference as an immutable one does not break the rules of ownership.\nBox - simple wrapper\nThe Box&lt;T&gt; type is the most basic out of Rust's smart pointers, equivalent to C++'s std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;. It's a simple wrapper that makes sure the underlying memory gets allocated and freed properly.\n\n(Download the source code for this example: box.rs)\nReference counting\nThe Rc&lt;T&gt; type is the equivalent of std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt; from C++. There is one caveat to this though - because we're creating multiple references to the same object, those references have to be immutable in accordance with the ownership rules.\n\n(Download the source code for this example: ref_count.rs)\nRust also provides a non-owning pointer in the form of Weak&lt;T&gt; (equivalent to std::weak_ptr&lt;T&gt;) that can be obtained from an instance of Rc&lt;T&gt;.\n\n(Download the source code for this example: weak_ref.rs)\nMutating the immutable\nGood examples and explanation of the interior mutability pattern and runtime borrow checking can be found in the book.\nAlongside the RefCell&lt;T&gt; type described above, there is an analogous Cell&lt;T&gt; type that operates on values instead of references.\nConvenient handling of dyn objects\nIn previous labs you learned about dynamic dispatch and its strengths. The largest drawback you noticed is most likely that they are unsized (!Sized, where ! being syntax signifying lack of trait implementation).\nWhen storing an object on a heap, however, we can use it as a dyn object seamlessly.\nObligatory reading\n\n\nThe Book, chapter 15\n\n\nstd::borrow::Cow, a versatile copy-on-write smart pointer\n\n\nAdditional reading\n\nOn wrapped references\nDeref vs AsRef vs Borrow\n\nAssignment 5 (graded)\nCorporations\nDeadline: 13.11.2024 23:59\n","id":"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/07-smart-pointers/","title":"Smart Pointers"},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/08-feedback-2/":{"body":"Feedback\nConditional implementation\n\nInstead of checking N == 3, you can provide different impls for SphereN&lt;2&gt; and\nSphereN&lt;3&gt; (as they are different types).\nu32 and u64\nThey are different types, but because you can easily cast one to another,\nit was not sufficient to make the implementation type-safe.\n","id":"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/08-feedback-2/","title":"Feedback #2"},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/09-concurrency/":{"body":"Parallelism vs Concurrency\nConcurrency is when tasks can make progress independently of each other.\nParallelism is when multiple tasks make progress at the same time.\nConcurrency models in Rust\nThreads\nNothing unusual here.\nThreads can be created with the thread::spawn function docs - please read them!.\nThis method returns a JoinHandle&lt;T&gt; which can be used to wait for the thread to finish. T is the type of the thread's return value.\nAnother way to spawn threads is using scope. Threads created in such way are mandatorily joined at the end of the scope, which guarantees that they will borrow items for no longer that the lifetime of the scope. Hence, they can borrow non-'static items!\nPropagating panics\nIn Rust a panic of one thread doesn't affect the other threads (similar to how Java handles exceptions in threads).\nClosures\nClosures which are used to create threads must take ownership of any values they use. It can be forced with the move keyword.\n\nNormal ownership rules still apply. It means that we cannot mutate the vector in the spawned thread from the main thread!\nBut what if we need to share some state?\nSend and Sync\nThey are marker traits used to indicate that a type or a reference to it can be used across threads. See the nomicon for more information.\n\n\nA type is Send if it is safe to move it (send it) to another thread.\nA type is Sync if it is safe to share (sync) between threads (T is Sync if and only if &amp;T is Send).\n\n\nThis makes sense, because Sync is about sharing object between threads, and &amp; is the shared reference.\nThere is also a great answer on Rust forum, listing + explaining example types that are !Send or !Sync.\nFor more convenient analysis, examples are listed here:\nSend + !Sync:\n\nUnsafeCell (=&gt; Cell, RefCell);\n\n!Send + !Sync:\n\nRc\n*const T, *mut T (raw pointers)\n\n!Send + Sync:\n\nMutexGuard (hint: !Send for POSIX reasons)\n\nExercise for the reader: explain reasons for all limitations of the above types.\nSharing state between threads\nMessage passing\nOne possible way is to use message passing. We can use a blocking queue (called mpsc - \"multi producer single consumer FIFO queue\") to do it.\nWe talked about blocking queues in the Concurrent programming class. In Rust, they are strongly-typed. Sending and receiving ends have different types.\nMutexes\nIn Rust, a mutex wraps a value and makes it thread-safe.\nBecause it becomes a part of the type, it's impossible to access the underlying value in an unsynchronized manner. It is conceptually similar to the RefCell type.\nArc is a smart pointer like Rc but it can be shared between threads.\nPlease read more about them in the book.\nThe docs also mention poisoning.\nRwLocks\nRwLocks are similar to mutexes, but they distinguish between read and write locks.\nAtomic types\nAtomic types are described in the docs.\n\nNote that atomic values don't have to be wrapped in a mutex when shared across threads.\nWait...\nIf most types are Sync + Send, then what stops us from using a standard, non-atomic integer in the example above?\n\n\n...so we would have to use a RefCell to be able to modify the value through a shared reference...\n\n...but RefCell isn't Sync:\n\nAnd that bound mentioned in the last line looks like this:\n\nExercise for the reader\nWhy is it impossible to share a reference to a Mutex between threads spawned with std::thread::spawn?\nData parallelism with Rayon\nRayon is a library for parallelization of data processing.\nIt can be used to parallelize the execution of functions over a collection of data by switching the standard Iterator to a ParallelIterator.\nIt works very similar to Java's parallel streams.\nWhy do that?

With this basic understanding of what we expect out of futures, let's try to come up with their details ourselves.\nWe know that, when asked, a future can either give us a ready value or still be waiting for it. Asking about the future's result is called polling. Our future could look something like this:\n\nThe poll method can be called to check for the result of the future. There is a flaw in this however - whatever is coordinating our future-based computations will have to constantly poll each of them in hope they are ready to do some work.\n\nWe can solve this by attaching a callback to our polling. The wake function passed to poll can be used to notify whoever issued the poll that the future is ready to make some progress and should be polled.\nLet's picture a quick example of how our SimpleFuture could be used.\n\nCombining futures\nWith the SimpleFuture at our disposal we can easily model more advanced concurrent computations.\n\nWe can also queue futures like this:\n\nExercise\nThe last example assumes that both futures are already constructed. In practice, however, we often want to chain futures that use the results of their predecessors, like this - get_breakfast().and_then(|food| eat(food));. Try implementing this behavior by adding a new method to the SimpleFuture trait called and_then and something that models this sequential computation (like the previous AndThenFut future).\nThe real deal\nWe weren't far from the actual way Rust's futures are structured. The Future trait looks as follows:\n\nThere are two differences here. Firstly, we use a context instead of a standalone wake method. Since this callback was just a simple function pointer, there was no way for it to hold any data pertaining to which future called it.\nSecondly, we take self as a Pin&lt;&gt;. This enables us to create immovable futures - we will go into it later.\nCoordinating futures - waker &amp; executor\nUsing wakers and context\nWe will follow the steps in the book to make a future that runs a separate thread that sleeps for a given duration and only then returns a result.\nExecutor\nWe will follow the steps in the book to create our own executor to run our futures on.\nObligatory reading\n\nPinning in detail\nPinning in even more detail\nAsync in depth\n\nAdditional reading\n\nWhat color is your function\nPin and suffering\nUnderstanding Rust futures by going way too deep\nDesugaring and assembly of Rust async/await\n\nAssignment 7 (graded)\nBack to the futures\nDeadline: 18.12.2024 23:59\n","id":"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/13-async-2/","title":"Async: Part 2"},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/14-macros/":{"body":"Reading\n\n\nThe Book, Chapter 19.5\n\n\nLittle Book of Macros\n\n\nMacro Workshop\n\n\n","id":"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/14-macros/","title":"Macros"},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/15-unsafe/":{"body":"Unsafe Rust Alter Ego\nSo far, no operation in Rust that we performed could trigger UB (Undefined Behaviour):\n\ndata races were prevented by sharing XOR mutability borrow checker rule;\nuse-after-free, dangling references, etc. were prevented by lifetimes &amp; ownership.\n\nBut no respectable, powerful programming language can stand being constrained that much, in such a cage!\nIn Rust, unsafe keyworld unleashes the hidden superpowers.\nUnsafe code superpowers\nInside a unsafe { ... } block, you can (and normally you can't):\n\nDereference a raw pointer,\nCall an unsafe function or method,\nAccess or modify a mutable static variable,\nImplement an unsafe trait,\nAccess fields of a union.\n\nThe first superpower is the most important.
