### Obligatory reading

1. We'll use the [Tokio tutorial](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial) (chapters `Overview`-`Channels`)
   to learn about both the syntax of `async`/`await` and how to use it in applications through `tokio`.
2. How to [think about `async`/`await`](https://cliffle.com/blog/async-inversion/), how they differ from normal functions.
3. How to [use the polled state machine](https://jeffmcbride.net/blog/2025/05/16/rust-async-functions-as-state-machines/) for our own goals.
4. How the [assembly code gets generated](https://www.eventhelix.com/rust/rust-to-assembly-async-await/) from `async`/`await`.
5. What happens with the [stack in coroutines](https://dev.to/leapcell/concurrency-in-go-vs-rustc-goroutines-vs-coroutines-27f5).
6. [Common Rust lifetime misconceptions](https://github.com/pretzelhammer/rust-blog/blob/master/posts/common-rust-lifetime-misconceptions.md).
