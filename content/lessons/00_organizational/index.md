# Rust course

We will be using [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) for task submission and [Discord](https://discord.gg/R5PMsBmtNh) for discussions.

Our learning/teaching materials are going to be:

- the content of this site - it contains explanations and questions tailored towards MIMUW students,
- well-known Rust teaching materials (["The Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/), ["Rust by Example"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html)) that complement this site,
- explanations/deeper insight during class and many examples of Rust code.

## Final grade

- 1/2 of the grade is based on small tasks.
  - There will be 8 or 9 tasks.
  - Each task will be graded on a scale of 0 to 3.
  - You can get up to 21 points from the small tasks. It means that it is enough to do 7 tasks with a score of 3 points.
  - You can solve the task between the end of the lesson and strictly before the start of the next lesson. The deadline is different for different lab groups.
  - Note: we will have 14 classes in total, so you can expect a task every week or two.
  - See the `Small task grading` lesson for the detailed rules, examples and penalties we apply when evaluating solutions.
- 1/2 of the grade is based on a big project. You can choose a topic yourself, but it must be accepted by us. The project has to be split into two parts. It can be done in groups of two (or bigger, if ambitious enough). The grading is as follows:
  1. Usability - 4 points.
  2. Usage of Rust functionalities - 6 points.
  3. Programming challenges - 5 points.
  4. Size of project - 4 points.
  5. Quality of code - 2 points.

  To score high on `Usability`, there shouldn't be any issues with running the project (be sure that all commands are running and that we will precisely know when and what to execute to test the project, if needed also try to give some reproduceable environment, e.g. docker). The `Usage of Rust functionalities` forces you to use harder features/bigger Rust libraries (async, wasm, gui, testing, macros, etc). The `Programming challenges` just means whether it was straightforward code that is simple to write, or something that required effort/thought/debugging. The `Size of project` just means how much features there are in the project, and how much meaningful code there is. If we don't have much comments about design of the code and there isn't any issues with readability, then `Quality of code` will be high.

In specific, individual cases, it is possible to raise the grade by doing additional work, but it has to be agreed by us beforehand and it should be not easier than going through the standard path.
The additional work might be:

- Making a presentation about some advanced topic (const generics, futures, macros, etc.) or about architecture of a selected Rust open-source library.
- Contributing to a selected Rust open-source library.
- Contributing to this course's materials.

## Big project deadlines

The deadlines for the big project (not to be confused with separate deadlines for the small projects) are set to the start of your class.
If you have a class on Wednesday at 12:15 and the project deadline is 2025-11-05 - 2025-11-06, then your deadline is 2025-11-05, 12:15.

1. 2025-11-05 - 2025-11-06: Project ideas should be presented to us for further refining. If you wish to pair up with someone, tell us before the deadline.
2. 2025-11-12 - 2025-11-13: Final project ideas should be accepted by now.
3. 2025-12-10 - 2025-12-11: Deadline for submitting the first part of the project.
4. 2026-01-07 - 2026-01-08: Deadline for submitting the second and final part of the project.
