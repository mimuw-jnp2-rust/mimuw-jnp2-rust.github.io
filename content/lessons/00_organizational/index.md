# Rust course

We will be using [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) for task submission and [Discord](https://discord.gg/UyvepYkPs9) for discussions.

Our main learning/teaching resource will be ["The Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).

Also worth mentioning: ["Rust by Example"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html).

## Grading

- 1/3 of the grade is based on small tasks. There will be approximately 1 task every two weeks and each task will be graded on a scale of 0 to 3.
- 2/3 of the grade is based on a big project. You can choose a topic yourself, but it must be accepted by me. The project has to be split into two parts. It can be done in groups of two (or bigger, if ambitious enough).
- The grade may be increased by a bonus. You can get a bonus for:
  - Making a presentation about some advanced topic (const generics, futures, macros, etc.) or about architecture of a selected Rust open-source library
  - Contributing to a selected Rust open-source library
  - Contributing to this course's materials
  - Quizzes, homeworks, general activity etc.
