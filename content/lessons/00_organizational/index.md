# Rust course

We will be using [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) for task submission and [Discord](https://discord.gg/UyvepYkPs9) for discussions.

Our learning/teaching materials are going to be:

- the content of this site - it contains explanations and questions tailored towards MIMUW students,
- well-known Rust teaching materials (["The Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/), ["Rust by Example"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html)) that complement this site,
- explanations/deeper insight during class and many examples of Rust code.

## Grading

- 1/2 of the grade is based on small tasks.
  - There will be 8 or 9 tasks.
  - Each task will be graded on a scale of 0 to 3.
  - You can get up to 21 points from the small tasks. It means that it is enough to do 7 tasks with a score of 3 points.
  - The tasks appear on Thursdays at 14:00 with a deadline until Tuesday 23:59. This means that everyone has exactly 5 days and 10 hours to solve a task.
  - Note: we will have 14 classes in total, so you can expect a task every week or two.
- 1/2 of the grade is based on a big project. You can choose a topic yourself, but it must be accepted by us. The project has to be split into two parts. It can be done in groups of two (or bigger, if ambitious enough). The grading is as follows:
  1. Usability - 4 points.
  2. Usage of Rust functionalities - 6 points.
  3. Programming challenges - 5 points.
  4. Size of project - 4 points.
  5. Quality of code - 2 points.

In specific, individual cases, it is possible to raise the grade by doing additional work, but it has to be agreed by us beforehand and it should be not easier than going through the standard path.
The additional work might be:

- Making a presentation about some advanced topic (const generics, futures, macros, etc.) or about architecture of a selected Rust open-source library.
- Contributing to a selected Rust open-source library.
- Contributing to this course's materials.

## Big project deadlines

The deadlines for the big project (not to be confused with separate deadlines for the small projects) are set to the start of your class.
If you have a class on Wednesday at 12:15 and the project deadline is 2025-11-05 - 2025-11-06, then your deadline is 2025-11-05, 12:15.

1. 2025-11-05 - 2025-11-06: Project ideas should be presented to us for further refining. If you wish to pair up with someone, tell us before the deadline.
2. 2025-11-12 - 2025-11-13: Final project ideas should be accepted by now.
3. 2025-12-10 - 2025-12-11: Deadline for submitting the first part of the project.
4. 2026-01-07 - 2026-01-08: Deadline for submitting the second and final part of the project.
