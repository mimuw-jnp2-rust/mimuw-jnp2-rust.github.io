## MarioMIM

[GitHub](https://github.com/KatKlo/rust-MarioMIM)

Katarzyna Kloc (GitHub: @KatKlo, email: kk429317@students.mimuw.edu.pl, linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/katarzyna-kloc-7a7503209/),
Patryk Bundyra (GitHub: PBundyra, email: pb429159@students.mimuw.edu.pl, linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/pbundyra/)

Since the moment CLion has shown us the first segfaults, we wanted to create a computer game inspired by the student’s adventure of pursuing a Computer Science degree. MarioMIM is a platform game whose main goal is to... get a degree. We’ve implemented a game inspired by Super Mario Bros, but in the special University of Warsaw edition. In order to overcome bugs, the student can strengthen himself by drinking coffee or learning the best programming language in the world - Rust.

Bevy, Rapier, Kira
