# JNP 3: Rust

We will be using [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) for task submission and [Discord](https://discord.gg/j2JFAsj7) for discussions.

Our main learning/teaching resource will be ["The Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).

## Grading

- 1/3 of the grade is based on small tasks. There will be approximately 1 task every two weeks and each task will be graded on a scale of 0 to 3.
- 2/3 of the grade is based on a big project. You can choose a topic yourself, but it must be accepted by me. The project has to be split into two parts. It can be done in groups of two (or bigger).
- The grade may be increased by a bonus. You can get a bonus for:
  - Making a presentation about some advanced topic (const generics, futures, macros, etc.) or about architecture of a selected Rust open-source library
  - Contributing to a selected Rust open-source library
  - Contributing to this course's materials
  - Quizzes, homeworks, etc.
