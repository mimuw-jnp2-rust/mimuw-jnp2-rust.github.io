# Closures

Closures (Polish: "domkniÄ™cia") are anonymous functions that can access variables from the scope in which they were defined.

We'll go through the examples from [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/fn/closures.html).

# Iterators

In Rust, there is no hierarchy of types for collections (because there is no inheritance in general).
Instead, what makes a collection is that it can be iterated over.

We'll go through the official [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/).
Most methods are defined in the [Iterator trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html).
