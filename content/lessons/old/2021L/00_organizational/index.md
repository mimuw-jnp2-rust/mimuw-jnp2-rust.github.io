# JNP 2: Rust

We will be using [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) for task submission.
Once you are enrolled in the Moodle course we will import the data into Classroom.

Our main learning/teaching resource will be ["The Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).

## Schedule

1. 2022-03-01: Introduction. Setting up the environment. Why Rust? "Hello world".
2. 2022-03-08: Ownership and borrow checking. Data types and structures.
3. 2022-03-15: Enums. Pattern matching. Option and Result. Cargo test.
4. 2022-03-22: Reasoning about types - generics, traits and lifetimes.
5. 2022-03-29: Closures and iterators.

## Grading

- 1/3 of the grade is based on small tasks. There will be approximately 1 task every two weeks and each task will be graded on a scale of 0 to 3.
- 2/3 of the grade is based on a big project. You can choose a topic yourself, but it must be accepted by us. The project has to be split into two parts. It can be done in groups of two.
- The grade may be increased by a bonus. You can get a bonus for:
  - Making a presentation about some advanced topic (const generics, futures, macros, etc.) or about architecture of a selected Rust open-source library
  - Contributing to a selected Rust open-source library
  - Contributing to this course's materials
